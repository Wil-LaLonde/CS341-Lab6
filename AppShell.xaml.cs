* Reflection: ->
* Wil LaLonde: I thought it was interesting getting some more experience with Git.
*              I've never really forked a repo before so this was something new to me.
*              Working with the code was interesting as well. It was also a challenge
*              to try and understand what was going on and try to fix various bugs
*              as well.
